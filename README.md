# DSA Practice Repository

This repository showcases my journey in solving algorithmic and data structure challenges, with solutions implemented in **C++**, and periodically synchronized with my LeetCode profile.

- **LeetCode Profile**: [Priyanshi Rawat](https://leetcode.com/u/priyanshipri_/)  
- **Primary Language**: C++

---

##  Structure

Solutions are organized by:
- **Topic** (e.g., Arrays, Trees, Dynamic Programming)
- **Problem Name / ID**

Each solution includes:
- Problem statement (copied from LeetCode)
- My C++ solution with clear comments
- Time & space complexity analysis

---

##  Goals

- Build a solid foundation in DSA through consistent practice
- Develop clean, efficient C++ code for algorithmic problems
- Maintain a progressive log of learning over time

---

##  How to Use This Repo

Clone the repo and browse solutions by category.  
Use it as:
- A study resource for DSA concepts  
- A revision reference before interviews or competitions  

---

##  Notes

- This is a personal learning log, not an exhaustive solutions catalog.
- The layout will evolve as I tackle more challengesâ€”stay tuned!
